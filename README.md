# Fashion_Mnist_classification
## Problem statement

The objective is to identify (predict) different fashion products from the
given images using 3 different transfered learning models (LeNet 5,
VGG19, AlexNet) with some preprocessing for each model of them.
The target dataset has 10 class labels, as we can see from above (0 – Tshirt/top, 1 – Trouser,,….9 – Ankle Boot).
Given the images of the articles, we need to classify them into one of
these classes, hence, it is essentially a ‘Multi-class Classification’
problem.
We will be using CNN to come up with a model for this problem and will
use “Accuracy” as the performance measure.

## Data description

The Fashion-MNIST dataset " https://www.kaggle.com/zalando-research/fashionmnist " consists of images of that originate from
Zalando’s image directory. Zalando is a European e-commerce company
founded in 2008.
The researchers in Zalando have created the Fashion-MNIST dataset that
contains 70,000 images of clothing. More specifically, it contains 60,000
training examples and 10,000 testing examples, that are all grayscale
images with the dimension 28 x 28 categorized into 10 classes.
The dataset is proposed as a more challenging replacement dataset for the
MNIST dataset.
